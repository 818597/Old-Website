        Future Plans
    </h5>
    <p>
        I am going to attend a four-year college in Minnesota this fall. I intend on majoring in computer science, and potentially doing a second major in computer engineering. I have narrowed down my colleges that I may want to attend to U of M Twin Cities, Bethel, Macalester, and Augsburg.
