    <p>
        I enjoy many different types  of games. I like to play Rocket League, PUBG, Age of Empires, and League of Legends with my friends. My LoL IGN is NotEnoughLettuce. I also play some single player games such as Dark Souls II-III, Sekiro, The Tomb Raider reboot,  and the Arkham games. Rocket League is by far my most competitive game as I was ranked Diamond 2. My friends and I will also organize Poker and other board game nights throughout the year.
